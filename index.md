2. Fill out the [pre-class survey](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s3E7pUYet2l0HmdgRuZVdU6RbuPisf8yqLIHx_erTgE).
3. Join our [Slack](https://ml-images.slack.com/) and poke around! For our class, we will be communicating through the `#runwayml-deepdive` channel.
4. Introduce yourself to your classmates in the `#runwayml-deepdive` channel. Say hi to each other! Some starter questions: Where are you located? What do you do? What experience do you have already? What do you want to learn or make? And links to your IG / twitter / website. :)
5. Read our class [Code of Conduct and Zoom Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6X4_uEdlx3Xo9ZM73nlltc690DcP4geSjImUEA7K98/edit?usp=sharing).

### Links and Resources
- Join the [Runway Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack)
- For a little more about Machine Learning and to see more examples of ML art I recommend my [Week 1 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUoCHglUKAo&list=PLWuCzxqIpJs_87U88Bwb-XpVwwj_Bpe_R&index=2&t=1s) from a previous course (note that a lot of the inspiration I show here isn’t doable in Runway, but we could think of ways to do similar things!)
- [A playlist of a bunch of dataset creation demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs9v81cWpRC7nm94eTMtohHq) (best for people who have some coding experience or want to learn to use the command line)
- [DeepDream using Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvOI_u0khTs). A better introduction to DeepDream and a much more flexible library. (Google Colab is free but might require a little coding knowledge. Try it!)

# Week 2, April 14
**_To-do before this class:_**

1. Find a model (or a few!) in Runway and play with it! In Slack, post:
    - What model did you use?
    - What the inputs and outputs were.
    - What questions you have about the model.
    - Show us what you made!

2. Think about a bigger project you want to work on. 
    - For inspiration: the [Runway Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack), the [Runway Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj598ZXODDO-k_-49mQsQZkrBP_9EMX48).
    - Consider with inputs you have available to you, and what you want as outputs.
